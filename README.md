# Solana Voting Smart Contract Deployment

This repository contains the source code for a Solana-based voting smart contract written in Rust. Follow the steps below to deploy the contract on the Solana blockchain.

## Prerequisites

1. **Rust**: Make sure you have Rust installed. You can install it by following the instructions on the official [Rust website](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

2. **Solana CLI**: Install the Solana Command Line Tools by following the instructions in the [official Solana documentation](https://docs.solana.com/cli/install-solana-cli-tools).

## Build the Smart Contract

1. Clone this repository:

    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```

2. Change to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd <project-directory>
    ```

3. Build the smart contract:

    ```bash
    cargo build-bpf
    ```

## Deploy the Smart Contract

1. Deploy a Program ID (PID) for the smart contract:

    ```bash
    solana create-program-address
    ```

   Take note of the generated Program ID as you'll need it for deploying the smart contract.

2. Deploy the smart contract to the Solana blockchain:

    ```bash
    solana deploy <path-to-binary> --program-id <generated-program-id>
    ```

   Replace `<path-to-binary>` with the path to the compiled binary produced by the `cargo build-bpf` command.

3. Save the deployed smart contract address for future reference.

## Interact with the Smart Contract

1. Initialize the voting system:

    ```bash
    solana <command> <program-id> <voter-account> <vote-account> ...
    ```

   Customize the `<command>` and provide additional parameters based on your specific smart contract initialization requirements.

2. Cast votes using the deployed smart contract:

    ```bash
    solana <command> <program-id> <voter-account> <vote-account> ...
    ```

   Customize the `<command>` and provide additional parameters based on your specific smart contract voting process.

## Additional Information

- Include any additional information or instructions that users may need to know.

- You may also want to include information on how to monitor the smart contract on Solana Explorer or any other relevant tools.
